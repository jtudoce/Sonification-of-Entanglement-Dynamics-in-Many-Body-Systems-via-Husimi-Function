# Sonification-of-Entanglement-Dynamics-in-Many-Body-Systems-via-Husimi-Function

This repository completes the paper on the same topic. 

The paper investigates sonification techniques applied to dynamical entanglement generation in many-body spin-1/2 systems with the help of phase space methods and entanglement measure. 
We study dynamics of entanglement generation in many-qubit system in dynamical protocol governed by three models: the the one-axis twisting model, the XXZ Heisenberg and a quantum kicked-rotor exhibiting both regular and quantum chaotic behavior. We present a procedure of entanglement dynamics sonification, allowing mapping the spin-$1/2$ Husimi function and von Neuman entanglement entropy to sound.
Results demonstrate how sonification enhances perception of dynamic entanglement offering intuitive and artistic insight into quantum correlations behaviors.
